# Drum-Kit

Welcome to the Drum-Kit project! This project is a simple web application that simulates a drum kit using JavaScript. The drum kit is fully interactive and can be played by clicking on the buttons or using the corresponding keyboard keys.

Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply visit the project website at https://sonnymay.github.io/Drum-Kit/ and the drum kit will load automatically.

Usage

The drum kit can be played by clicking on the buttons or using the corresponding keyboard keys. Each button and key corresponds to a different drum sound, allowing the user to create their own drum beats and rhythms.
